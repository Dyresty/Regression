## Simple Linear Regression 

y' = b0 + b1X1<br>
Dependent Variable = b0(y-intercept)(constant) + X1(Independent Variable).b1(Slope Coefficient)<br>

### Ordinary Least Squares
Yi actaual value<br>
yi^ predicted value<br>
residual Ei = yi - y-^<br>
y^ = b0 + b1X1<br>

Our goal is to get the b0 and b1 values such that the sum of the residuals is minimized.<br>
ie, the Sum of (yi - yi^)^2 is minimized.<br>
