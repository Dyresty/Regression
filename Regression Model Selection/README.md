# Regression Model Selection

Selection of the model to use can be made using thes templates.<br>
This template assumes the dataset has no missing values, or categorical data, and that only the last column is the dependent variable.<br><br>
We will be using R^2 for evaluating the regression model.<br>

The dataset has 4 independent variables and 1 dependent variable. This can be used to evaluate the Regression Models.<br><br>
