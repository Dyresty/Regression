# Regression
Machine Learning - Regressing Model Projects 

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. 
If the independent variable is time, then the model will be forecasting future values, otherwise the model will be predicting present but unknown values. 

There are multiple Machine Learning Regression models:
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Support Vector for Regression (SVR)
5. Decision Tree Regression
6. Random Forest Regression
